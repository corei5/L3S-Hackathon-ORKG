        "We build the next generation digital libraries for semantic scientific knowledge communicated in scholarly literature. We focus on the communicated content rather than the context e.g., people and institutions in which scientific knowledge is communicated, and the content is semantic i.e., machine interpretable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scientific knowledge continues to be confined to the document, seemingly inseparable from the medium as hieroglyphs carved in stone. The global scientific knowledge base is little more than a collection of documents. It is written by humans for humans, and we have done so for a long time. This makes perfect sense, after all it is people that make up the audience, and researchers in particular.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yet, with the monumental progress in information technologies over the more recent decades, one may wonder why it is that the scientific knowledge communicated in scholarly literature remains largely inaccessible to machines. Surely it would be useful if some of that knowledge is more available to automated processing.\n",
