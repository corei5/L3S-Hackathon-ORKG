# Prototype with LLMs and ORKG

Welcome to the L3S-Hackathon-ORKG repository! This repository is dedicated to our collaborative efforts during the L3S Hackathon (for ORKG), where we will explore and leverage the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) to address pressing challenges in scholarly knowledge extraction and natural language processing.
